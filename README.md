## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.x. In addition, the code runs using these libraries:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. plotnine
5. scikit-learn
6. xgboost


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the kaggle boxofficemojo dataset to better understand:

1. How can we define a successful movie from a financial perspective?
2. What internal factors (film production phase) define a successful movie?
3. Are these factors able to predict the success of a given film?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here attempts to answers the questions outlined in the Project Motivation using exploratory and predictive analysis. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.   
In addition, there is a csv file that contains the dataset necessary for the analysis

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@shosan_71491/producing-a-winning-movie-are-early-stages-of-production-features-central-in-predicting-a-33ce741ebebb)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data.  Is it possibile to find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/igorkirko/wwwboxofficemojocom-movies-with-budget-listed)
